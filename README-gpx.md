~/Documents/gpx/archives contains all .gdb and .gpx file found on all backups. The gdb files were converted to gpx with gpsbabel (see gdb-to-gpx.sh) ---hence many duplicates! Duplicates were removed with jdupes but since gpsbabel files are slightly different from mapsource gpx files, not many were removed. Additional duplicates were removed using the scripts test_and_clean.sh (checks for tracks with perls script xmlgpx.pl) and test_sort_hash_and_clean.sh (checks for same tracks). Subsequently the files were opened 1by1 in Viking. the tracks were sorted (date ascending) and the whole layer (including routes and waypoints) exported to new gpx files with a new name indicating the date of the tracks (and some indication of where) under .../TracksEtc/. Some further duplicates were found and removed in Viking. The files were then moved to the appropriate year/gpx in the PICTURES tree. No files were found for the period 2011-2015??
