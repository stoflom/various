#!/bin/bash
# Main orchestration script for Btrfs Incremental Backups.
# This script uses helper functions defined in btrfs_backup.sh to create
# and send Btrfs snapshots to a backup destination.
#
# Must be run as root.
#
# Usage:
#   ./btrfs_backup_main.sh [-s] [-h|--help]
#
# Arguments:
#   -s: Enables a re-send and verification mode for the latest local snapshots.
#       When this flag is provided, the script does NOT create new snapshots.
#       Instead, for each subvolume, it finds the latest local snapshot and checks
#       if it exists and is complete on the backup destination. If the snapshot
#       is missing or incomplete, it will be (re-)sent.
#   -h, --help: Display the help message and exit.

# Exit on error, treat unset variables as errors, and propagate exit status in pipelines.

# Define the subvolumes to back up in an array. The script will derive
# the snapshot directory and name prefix from these paths. The directory
# for snapshots will be created under each source subvolume root (e.g., /home/snapshots)
# and the unique snapshot name will be the basename of the subvolume path + timestamp.

Main orchestration script for Btrfs Incremental Backups.
Must be run as root.

Arguments:
  -s|--send: Enables a re-send and verification mode for the latest local snapshots.
      When this flag is provided, the script does NOT create new snapshots.
      Instead, for each subvolume, it finds the latest local snapshot and checks
      if it exists and is complete on the backup destination. If the snapshot
      is missing or found to be incomplete, it will be (re-)sent. This is
      useful for retrying failed or interrupted transfers.
